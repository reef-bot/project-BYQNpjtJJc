# Discord Bot Project: Moderation Bot

## Project Description
This project aims to create a moderation Discord bot that can assist server administrators in managing and monitoring their communities effectively. The bot will have features such as muting, kicking, banning, warning, and logging actions taken against users.

## Improvements Needed
- Implement a user-friendly command system for easy bot interaction.
- Add a feature for automatic message filtering to catch inappropriate content.
- Integrate a reporting system for users to report violations easily.
- Include a customizable permissions system to give different levels of moderation control to server staff.
- Develop a dashboard for server administrators to monitor bot activity and manage settings.

## Project Execution
1. Research existing Discord bot frameworks and select the most suitable one for the project.
2. Design a database structure to store user information, warnings, and other relevant data.
3. Create the core functionality of the bot, including moderation commands and logging capabilities.
4. Test the bot extensively in a sandbox environment to ensure it works as intended.
5. Solicit feedback from beta testers and make necessary improvements based on their suggestions.
6. Launch the bot to the public and provide ongoing support and updates to address any issues or add new features as needed.
